Throughout, you will learn about the Software Craftsmanship attitude to development and how to apply it to your workplace. Writing <b>Clean Code</b> is difficult. Cleaning existing code, even more so. You should attend if you want to:<ul><li>Write clean code that is easy to understand and maintain</li><li>Become more proficient in Test-Driven Development (TDD): using tests to design and build your code base</li><li>Focus your tests and production code according to business requirements using Outside-In TDD (a.k.a. the London School of TDD)</li><li>Understand design principles that lead to clean code</li><li>Avoid over-engineering and large rewrites by incrementally evolving your design using tests</li></ul></p><p>Once you have an understanding of the principles at work, we will apply them to <b>Legacy Code</b> to help you gain confidence in improving legacy projects through testing, refactoring and redesigning. <b>The course is fully hands-on and developers will be writing a lot of code.</b></p>",

It takes the concept of function composition and lazy evaluations to the next level. It streamlines handling of many critical issues that are architectural in nature: resilience, scale, responsiveness, and messaging.</p><p>In this workshop, we will start with a quick introduction to reactive programming. We will then dive into code examples and learn how to create reactive applications. We’ll learn to implement observables, to deal with errors in a graceful manner, learn both synchronous and asynchronous solutions, hot vs. cold observables, and dealing with backpressures.</p><p>Bring your own laptop, install Java 9 and your favourite IDE and let's get you ready for writing reactive applications!</p>",

As our world becomes digital, today’s safely-hidden back office system is tomorrow’s public API, open to anyone on the Internet with a hacking tool and time on their hands. So the days of hoping that security is someone else’s problem are over. The security community has developed a well understood set of principles used to build systems that are secure (or at least securable) by design, but this topic often isn’t included in the training of software developers, assuming that it’s only relevant to security specialists. In this talk, we will briefly discuss why security needs to be addressed as part of architecture work and then introduce a set of proven principles for the architecture of secure systems, explaining each in the context of mainstream system design, rather than in the specialised language of security engineering. Our technical examples will be Java centric, but the principles are equally applicable to other technology stacks.",

This sessions draws on my experience leading a team that transformed our entire architecture in under 6 months, where we also managed to cut cost by over 90%, and increased production deployments from 4-6 per month to 80-100 per month. We did that whilst coming up with solutions to those common operational concerns to ensure we not only run a serverless architecture in production, but we do so responsibly. The audience should have basic understanding of how AWS Lambda works, and are aware of some popular AWS services like DynamoDB, Kinesis, S3. I’m the best person to speak on the subject as I lead the team on this migration and were responsible for large parts of the actual implementation, and as the architect I was also responsible for our entire architecture (and the first one to be woken up at night if things go wrong!). I have written extensively on the operational aspect of working with AWS Lambda, and my work has been regularly referenced by the AWS Lambda team including talks at re:invent, as well as the new Serverless Well Architected whitepaper.",

How do you find the bottlenecks when just drawing a web page requires fifty HTTP requests? What happens when one of your API consumers accidentally tries to GET your entire customer database? Most of us are familiar with the architectural style known as REST, but even experienced developers often find it difficult to translate REST's architectural principles into running code. In this talk, we'll explore the elements of REST related to hypermedia and the principle of \"hypermedia as the engine of application state\" (HATEOAS) - we'll talk about why they matter, and when you might want to implement them in your own systems. We'll look at some of the tools that exist to help you design, deliver and debug your HTTP APIs, and we'll do some hands-on coding to show you what these patterns look like in a .NET web application using the HAL hypermedia application language.",

                      "title": "Kotlin in Real Projects: Pragmatic Opinion on Pragmatic Language",
                      "description": "Kotlin is a marvelous JVM language that many have waited for. While we already have Java 8 and some people have migrated away from JVM while waiting for a more productive language, Kotlin finally is here, promising lots of good stuff, but still allowing us to use the cross-platform and highly optimized JVM and many of familiar frameworks. However, nothing comes without drawbacks. There have been some controversial decisions while designing the language that affect what is convenient to do in the language and what is not so. Moreover, Kotlin is yet to deliver many of its promises, like compilation speed. In this talk I'll talk about real life experience of using Kotlin in an Agile way, the obstacles that you may encounter and how to overcome them.",
