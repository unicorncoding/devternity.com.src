It matters that we feel the fear now and need to deal with it. Rewrite or refactor? How do we write tests? There’s so much to change; how do we get started? In the typical programmer’s day job, there’s no time to learn how to do this. We’re already behind schedule and the cost of fixing the legacy code is crushing us. We need a way to learn how to do this safely, correctly, and eventually, even quickly. That’s what Surviving Legacy Code is about.",

At the same time, the second wave of digitization is rolling, turning IT systems into an essential ingredient of our business models. In this context, good architectural work is crucial. But instead we often observe a perfect confusion without clear direction - ranging from BDUF over several flavors of hype-driven, lots of one-size-fits-all to dogmatic pseudo-agile \"no architecture\". Yet, we have been told that architecture is about those decisions that really hurt if you get them wrong. <strong>How can we minimize the risk of getting hurt, especially if we need to go fast? Which approach is right</strong>?",

Then, after rediscovering why we need architectural work at all, we will set up a surprisingly simple down-to-earth approach for implementing it. After that, we will fill the building blocks one by one. Finally, we will complete the picture by discussing questions like: When should we do what? How much should we do in which context? How can we create a sustainable architecture and where are the limits? Plus some more topics. All this will happen in a mix of bits of theory, lots of interaction and hands-on, plus room for questions, discussion, tips, tricks and more. <strong>After this workshop, you will have a better understanding what architectural work actually is about, what is important, what is not, and how to tackle it in practice.</strong></p>",

We remove abstractions, complex structures, and focus building on the axis of change, then what's next? What new structures, patterns, and policies will need to be introduced in this style of architecture? How will we deal with common business functionality, and where do concepts like CQRS and DDD fit in? In this session, we'll introduce the idea of vertical slice architectures, and dive into the patterns, tools, and techniques used with slices. We'll also cover how you can fit vertical slices into different kinds of systems, from desktop, SPA, and normal MVC applications. Finally, we'll look at some of the new challenges that come with slices and layers, and how a different approach provides a much more maintainable end result.",

I will talk about my experiences from the last 15 years, including small software delivery teams until big financial institutions. Why would a company like to be \"agile\"? How can a company achieve that? How can you achieve Technical Excellence in your software teams? What developer skills are more important than languages, methods or frameworks?

It explores exactly what's evil about feature branches, which is not necessarily the problems they introduce - but rather, the real reasons why teams are using them.

This architecture has become popular because of its amenability to modification as an evolutionary architecture and its support for practices such as TDD. In this presentation we will discuss the clean architecture and its benefits. More than that, in the bulk of the presentation, we will show you how to implement a clean architecture in .NET. From first steps to working code, we will show you the moves required to embrace this approach, and introduce you to some of the OSS libraries that can help you get there. All examples will be in .NET Core",

In complex business domains, it's often difficult to know where to start. When we get our boundaries wrong, the clocks starts ticking. Before long, we hear ourselves say \"it would be easier to re-write it\". Join Adam for practical advice on discovering the hidden boundaries in your systems. Help tease out the natural separation of concerns in a sample business domain. During 20 years of developing complex systems, Adam has had plenty of time to get things wrong.

Others think, it is just about tools and automation. But in its core, DevOps is about accelerating the IT value chain. How long does it take to deliver a business idea to your customer using IT? How fast can you go - repeatedly and without compromising quality? But why should we speed up in the first place? Do we really need it? How fast is fast enough? How can we implement it? What else do we need to take into account? ... lots of questions if we follow this thought for a moment. In this session we will try to answer some of the questions. We will examine the drivers and goals behind DevOps and answer the question why we need to change. Then we will see how DevOps affects the way we think and act, what else is needed to really \"become DevOps\" and how all these building blocks are connected to each other. Finally, we will have a brief peek into the (likely) future of DevOps.",

Taking into account that people are extremely more complicated creature than ants it is possible to assume that making every team member productive definitely will not give us a productive team as a whole. The fundamental feature of any productive team is the ability to collaborative problem-solving. The most common reason for a problem to occur is that too often we see the same thing in different ways (typically all of us are wrong) and at the same time, we can poorly express our thought. I’m going to share with you some simple and useful tools that could help us better understand each other and to find better solutions for the problems we face.",

Companies seem to want to hire \"the best\", but well-balanced programmers relatively rare. Although many programmers feel confident arguing about algorithms, modularity, and scalability in design sessions, they would stand out from their peers if they also had incredible habits for managing their work, knew how to negotiate features with product owners, had intelligent conversations with project managers about the risks in their project, and understood what lies behind the irrationality of the people and systems around them. Sadly, most programmers don't appreciate the value of these skills. Others don't know how to get started learning them. I started programming computers because people are messy! I'd like to share a curated collection of concepts for you explore that will help you become irresistibly valuable to your employer or clients. I plan to share the design principles and programming techniques that amplified my skills the most over the last 20 years. In addition, I'll describe how I learned the key non-programming concepts, techniques, and approaches that have endeared me to fellow programmers, managers, and clients. I offer you a very practical approach to issues like influencing peers, negotiating with stakeholders, and adopting new ways of working safely. I'll help you start to build a personal work system that will free your mind to do your best work. I know how this might sound. I promise to share concrete techniques that you can begin applying right away. Of course, these techniques aren't magic, so you'll have to read some more and practise on your own, but you will know how to get started right away on becoming the well-balanced programmer that every manager and co-worker will love to have on their team.",

Most developers, however, struggle with the complexities of patterns, frameworks, tools and get lost in the complexities involved. In this session, we will code a complete example of an event-sourced service using no frameworks and no additional magic. We will use the open source database \"Eventstore\" and NodeJS and nothing else. Ok, maybe Docker and a light-weight web framework. By coding a real example, we will discuss patterns that you can use when building your systems, such as: handling read models, dealing with concurrency and validation, deleting data. So if you want to look behind the magic of event sourcing, join me on this hands-on journey.",
