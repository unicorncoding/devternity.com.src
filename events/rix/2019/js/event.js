What does Lean Code and its creation look like? There is a need to move beyond often separated worlds of software craft and agile development, to properly embrace code in its detail, but to also connect it more completely to the flow of business and the intelligence of people around it. To move beyond simple exhortations of clean code to something more human. This talk offers a fresh look at Lean principles and practices from the perspective of the code and the coder, rather than the usual scale of the organisation and the development process.",

                    "description": "A well-balanced programmer feels comfortable dealing with designing software, managing projects, and working with people. Companies seem to want to hire \"the best\", but well-balanced programmers relatively rare. Although many programmers feel confident arguing about algorithms, modularity, and scalability in design sessions, they would stand out from their peers if they also had incredible habits for managing their work, knew how to negotiate features with product owners, had intelligent conversations with project managers about the risks in their project, and understood what lies behind the irrationality of the people and systems around them. Sadly, most programmers don't appreciate the value of these skills. Others don't know how to get started learning them. I started programming computers because people are messy! I'd like to share a curated collection of concepts for you explore that will help you become irresistibly valuable to your employer or clients. I plan to share the design principles and programming techniques that amplified my skills the most over the last 20 years. In addition, I'll describe how I learned the key non-programming concepts, techniques, and approaches that have endeared me to fellow programmers, managers, and clients. I offer you a very practical approach to issues like influencing peers, negotiating with stakeholders, and adopting new ways of working safely. I'll help you start to build a personal work system that will free your mind to do your best work. I know how this might sound. I promise to share concrete techniques that you can begin applying right away. Of course, these techniques aren't magic, so you'll have to read some more and practise on your own, but you will know how to get started right away on becoming the well-balanced programmer that every manager and co-worker will love to have on their team.",

                      "description": "What is the clean architecture and how you would build one in .NET? Recently Bob Martin has categorized a set of architectures, including hexagonal architecture, onion architecture and screaming architecture as 'the clean architecture' - a layered architecture of concentric circles with a strong emphasis on separation of concerns. This architecture has become popular because of its amenability to modification as an evolutionary architecture and its support for practices such as TDD. In this presentation we will discuss the clean architecture and its benefits. More than that, in the bulk of the presentation, we will show you how to implement a clean architecture in .NET. From first steps to working code, we will show you the moves required to embrace this approach, and introduce you to some of the OSS libraries that can help you get there. All examples will be in .NET Core",

We remove abstractions, complex structures, and focus building on the axis of change, then what's next? What new structures, patterns, and policies will need to be introduced in this style of architecture? How will we deal with common business functionality, and where do concepts like CQRS and DDD fit in? In this session, we'll introduce the idea of vertical slice architectures, and dive into the patterns, tools, and techniques used with slices. We'll also cover how you can fit vertical slices into different kinds of systems, from desktop, SPA, and normal MVC applications. Finally, we'll look at some of the new challenges that come with slices and layers, and how a different approach provides a much more maintainable end result.",

In complex business domains, it's often difficult to know where to start. When we get our boundaries wrong, the clocks starts ticking. Before long, we hear ourselves say \"it would be easier to re-write it\". Join Adam for practical advice on discovering the hidden boundaries in your systems. Help tease out the natural separation of concerns in a sample business domain. During 20 years of developing complex systems, Adam has had plenty of time to get things wrong.

Join this session to see how to use Kubernetes to launch, manage, and rolling-upgrade a fleet of Java application instances with session replication. Kubernetes builds on top of Docker to construct a clustered container scheduling service. Kubernetes enables users to ask a cluster to run a set of containers. The system will automatically pick worker nodes to run those containers on, which we think of more as “scheduling” than “orchestration”. Kubernetes also provides ways for containers to find and communicate with each other and ways to manage both tightly coupled and loosely coupled sets of cooperating containers. In this session, you’ll learn: how to containerize different Java-based microservice workloads using Docker and different build tool plugins, deploying and managing a fleet of Java-based microservices in Kubernetes, service discovery 101 in Kubernetes, how to perform critical DevOps steps, such as canary, rolling update, roll backs, and some tips and tricks!"
